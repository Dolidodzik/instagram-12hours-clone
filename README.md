# instagram-12hours-clone
I tried to re-create as much instagram functionalities in 12 hours, I acomplished a lot, when it comes to backend, however I didn't manage to create all the frontend in given time. Overall, I am happy with final result, although I think I could do better.

I used DjangoRestFramework and React as tech stack.

It was 12 hours challange, however I'll probably work on this repo untill I finish whole app (it's not my priority so it may take a lot of time), here's link to commit where I finished after 12 hours - https://github.com/Dolidodzik/instagram-12hours-clone/commit/6c9e64193a9f57884aaec4d4f5d9fbfe4833ea6f.
